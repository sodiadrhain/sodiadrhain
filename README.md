### Hello, My Lord. May I? 👋

Before you is a homosapien that has a knack for many things. _Believe you me_, I love building tools for [developers](https://dev.to/unicodeveloper), [writing](https://medium.com/@unicodeveloper), [speaking](https://speakerdeck.com/unicodeveloper), [building developer communities](https://www.benjamindada.com/forloop-africa/) and slapping my keyboard till something works. :collision:

I adore wicked people. I'm specifically referring to folks that are wicked about their personal growth. :grin:

:sparkles: Bombastic rhetorics abound that [@codebeast](https://twitter.com/codebeast) is human. Lies! My rebuttal accentuates his humanoid status--**half-human, half-robot, and definitely half-spirit**. :alien:

Finally, I'm currently obssessed with improving the quality of life of Nigerians through [Eden Life](https://ouredenlife.com). :four_leaf_clover: :seedling:
